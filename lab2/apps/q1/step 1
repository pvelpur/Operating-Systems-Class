Problem 1

(2 points) How many semaphores are available in DLXOS?
	- A maximum of 32 semaphores are allowed in the system

(2 points) How many locks are available in DLXOS?
	- A maximum of 64 locks are allowed in the system

(2 points) How is a semaphore created in DLXOS?
	- You can make a semaphore by using 'sem_create'

(2 points) Explain how sem_signal and sem_wait work.
	- sem_wait
        Decrements the count of semaphore and waits if count is negative.
        if sem is invalid, it returns 1 without waiting and without modifying count
        otherwise, it returns 0 indicating call was successful.
	- sem_signal
	    increments count of semaphore and wakes up a process waiting on semaphore.
	    If sem is invalid, it returns 1 without waiting or modifying the count.
	    Otherwise, it returns 0 indicating call was successful.

(2 points) What is a handle and how is it used to access semaphores in DLXOS?
	- Handle takes a number to run a process so that it doesnt give access to the user
	  directly. It's a unique pointer to a semaphore or a shared memory page and these
	  specific items can be accessed through the handles
